Cybersecurity hasn’t gotten simpler, but getting started has clearer paths. Here’s a short, practical plan I wish I had when I began.

1) Learn the foundations
- Networking basics (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP).
- Linux fundamentals and command line fluency.
- One scripting language (Python or Bash).

2) Hands-on practice
- Build a home lab (VMs, containerized apps).
- Do beginner CTFs and practice on safe platforms (TryHackMe, Hack The Box practice ranges).
- Read real bug reports and write simple remediation notes.

3) Focus areas for 2025
- Cloud security (IAM, secure configurations).
- Web application security and API security.
- Secure software development and SAST/DAST basics.

4) Creds and learning pathways
- Vendor-neutral certs (CompTIA Security+, eJPT) for starters.
- Practical courses, micro-certificates, and project-based learning beat memorization.

5) Career habits
- Contribute to open-source or write short technical posts.
- Build a public portfolio with labs and write-ups.
- Join local or online security communities for mentorship and reviews.

6) Ethics always
- Only practice on systems you own or are authorized to test.
- Learn responsible disclosure and follow legal guidelines.

Keep it practical: learn by doing, document everything, and iterate. The field rewards persistence and curiosity more than chasing rare certificates.
