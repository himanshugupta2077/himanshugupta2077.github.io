AI is now an everyday tool in security workflows. Here’s how I use it—and how to stay effective and ethical.

What AI helps with
- Automation: triage alerts, summarize logs, prioritize findings.
- Recon and mapping: synthesize public data into asset inventories.
- Report writing: convert notes into concise, reproducible findings.
- Augmenting red-team work: generate test plans, suggest fuzzing ideas, and automate repetitive tasks.

Using AI as a pen-tester (responsibly)
- Treat AI as an assistant, not an oracle. Verify every output.
- Use it to accelerate reconnaissance, craft hypothesis-driven tests, and draft remediation steps.
- Never use AI to produce exploit code or perform unauthorized attacks. Follow legal and ethical boundaries.

Prompt engineering — practical tips
- Be explicit about scope and constraints in the prompt.
- Ask for structured outputs (tables, checklists) to reduce follow-up work.
- Example prompt for planning a test:
  "Given this authorized scope and asset list, produce a prioritized penetration test plan with reconnaissance steps, likely attack surfaces, and required tools. Keep it high level."

Limitations and risks
- AI can hallucinate, miss context, or suggest insecure advice—always validate.
- Be mindful of data privacy when feeding internal artifacts to third-party models.
- Use local or enterprise-grade models for sensitive work where possible.

Bottom line: AI accelerates many tasks, but real security judgment still comes from hands-on experience, validation, and judgment.
