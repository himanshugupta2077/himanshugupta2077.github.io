SafePass is an offline password manager written in Python with Tkinter. This application allows you to store all your passwords inside a single database collection, MongoDB, which is secured with the SHA 256 hashing function. The hash key and salt are stored in the system's keyring to cross-check with the entered password. The user can add passwords and other necessary fields (Title, URL, Username, Password, Notes).
